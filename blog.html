                        This last weekend, I don’t know what we did but they say if you can’t remember it, it must have been great. That
                        doesn’t much help me with this article though… Let’s see. So Friday was the 30th of November and I was having that
                        feeling like “It’s ‘enter upcoming month here’ already?… wait wait wait. let me tell you what just happened. Jenny,
                        (my wife if you don’t know) just about popped open a can of mountain dew voltage… for herself. I think this is
                        working. (the secret plan to rub off on my wife). So, back to the not-really-a-story story about my weekend. So
                        Saturday, …this is going awesome. Um Saturday… what did I do again? -He looks at his calendar- …sorry. Got lost
                        talking to my wife about replacing Velcro on one of our younger son’s boots. My wife is trying out her “maker
                        skills” to cut off old Velcro with scissors and attach new adhesive-backed Velcro so that these boots can last a
                        little longer. So the moral of the story is that life can still be fun and happy even if you don’t remember what
                        you did last weekend, as long as you can have fun making fun of yourself while writing a random blog article about
                        happy family life.
